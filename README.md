# üß† Neural Network for Digit Recognition

This project implements an artificial neural network (ANN) that recognizes handwritten digits. It uses the MNIST dataset and is built entirely with NumPy, PIL, and scikit-learn‚Äîwithout high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
The goal is to gain a solid understanding of forward and backpropagation, weight updates, and visualization of neural network processes.
